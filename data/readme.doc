In the following directories are daily UV Index forecasts for each of the 
original 58 cities.  A file "cities.lst" gives the full name of the 3 letter
station name.  
Years < 2006: The data within each city file contains the forecast date,
station id, clear sky UV Index, UV Index Issued (inclusion of cloud effects),
percent probability clear, percent probability scattered, percent probability
broken, total ozone amount.  Percent probability overcast is not given, it is
computed from 1 - (%clr + %scat + %brkn).

Years 2006+ : Columns are: Station Name, Date (YYYYMMDD), Clear Sky UVI, 
Cloudy Sky UVI, Cloud Transmission, Solar Zenith Angle, Aerosol Transmission,
and Total column ozone.

Not every day is recorded so beware of gaps in coverage.
